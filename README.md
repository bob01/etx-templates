# Welcome to etx-Templates for EdgeTX
**New model templates for our ELRS RotorFlight electric and nitro R/C Helicopters**<br>Thanks to Mike W. and Diego A. for the endless hours of testing and great ideas.

** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK **


### About etx-Templates
These templates have been created to quickly create new EdgeTx models for our standard ELRS RotorFlight configurations with all of the boilerplate stuff out of the way.
The idea is... 
- new model
- name it, give it an image and maybe labels
- bind or assign a receiver ID if using model match
- customize switch assignments, battery warnings etc (or not)
- verify that all controls are correct and setup is SAFE
- GO FLY<br>No need to know what an input, mixer, logical switch, special function or global variable is ...<br>unless you really want to...

Best used with [etx-presets (for RotorFlight)](https://github.com/bob01/etx-presets-rotorflight)

### Release notes
- 2024.07.09 - eThrottle - Report "Bad Auto" + haptic if GOV reports LOST-HS ie bailout will not be available
- 2024.05.22 - v2.3 - model editor now sets the cell count setting of power bar widget, BEC voltage source defaults to servo bus telemetry sensor as more FC's are providing this sensor.
- 2024.05.15 - v2.1 - adjusted RPM tele ratio to 0 to address EdgeTx 2.10.0-rc4 to 2.10.0 release changes

### Requirements / dependencies
- RadioMaster Tx16s or equivalent (large color screen)
- EdgeTx 2.10 or later
- RotorFlight 2 or later
- flight controller should have be prepared with (** coming soon **) or a compatible configuration (modes/adjustments/telemetry etc) 


### Features
- familiar helicopter radio look and feel
- familiar/practical main screen
- summary screen automatically displayed at end of the flight
- familiar/throttle curves (TC1, TC2, TC3, TCH)
- standard primary switch configurations (bank, safety, motor etc)
- configured telemetry sensors w/ recognizable names, units, ratios all preset
- familiar mixer channel mappings
- output channel endpoints and subtrim aligned to ELRS (make sure your Tx sticks are calibrated)
- logical switch and special functions implementing warnings, various telemetry monitoring
- optional switches for RF blackbox and EdgeTX SD logging
- 4 bank / profile configuration
- main screen uses etx-widgets (https://github.com/bob01/etx-widgets), included in this package

## Start by creating a new model using the EdgeTx wizard...

### The model editor follows for switch assignments and voltage monitors etc.

### Bind or assign receiver ID, be sure to check your ELRS settings - D500 packet rate recommended
