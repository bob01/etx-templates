# Welcome to etxTemplates for EdgeTX
**New model templates for our ELRS RotorFlight electric and nitro R/C Helicopters**


### About etxTemplates
These templates have been created to quickly create new EdgeTx models for our standard ELRS RotorFlight configurations with all of the boilerplate stuff out of the way.
The idea is... 
- new model
- name it, give it an image and maybe labels
- bind or assign a receiver ID if using model match
- set the 3 global variables for rx and batt warnings (or not)
- GO FLY


### Requirements / dependencies
- EdgeTx 2.10 or later
- RotorFlight 2 or later
- flight controller should have be prepared with (** coming soon **) or a compatible configuration (modes/adjustments/telemetry etc) 


### Features
- familiar helicopter radio look and feel
- familiar/practical main screen
- summary screen automatically displayed at end of the flight
- familiar/throttle curves (TC1, TC2, TC3, TCH)
- standard primary switch configurations (bank, safety, motor etc)
- configured telemetry sensors w/ recognizable names, units, ratios all preset
- familiar mixer channel mappings
- output channel endpoints and subtrim aligned to ELRS (make sure your Tx sticks are calibrated)
- logical switch and special functions implementing warnings, various telemetry monitoring
- optional switches for RF blackbox and EdgeTX SD logging
- 4 bank / profile configuration
- main screen uses etx-widgets (https://github.com/bob01/etx-widgets), included in this package
